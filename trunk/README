ShortUr is a utility that allows long, convoluted URLs to be accessed by short, meaningful URLs on your site.                          

ShortUr requires PHP, Apache, mod_rewrite and MySQL.

ShortUr was written by Bryan Zera (bzera@colum.edu) with design help from Ivan Brunetti (ibrunetti@colum.edu) and the generous support of Columbia College Chicago.
